1. Requirements: The requirements are given in the assignment, but you have to add any
new requirements needed by your particular store implementation.

RESPONDER


2. Project Description: Describe how your project implements the functionality in the
requirements. Diagrams can help a lot here.

RESPONDER


3. Comments About the Code: Any comment you may want to add to help understand
your code. This is good programming practice.




4. Test Plan: Text describing the tests that will be performed. If an automatic test
tool/framework is used (ex: Selenium, jUnit, Spock), the code for the tests can be used.




5. Test Results: Text describing the test results. If an automatic test tool/framework is used,
its output can be used.





6. Build Procedures: A step-by-step guide to run your code. You should start telling how to
install whatever software you need, then how to download/build your program, and finally
how to set up the environment to run it. Imagine that someone installing will just follow
these commands (nothing more).




7. Problems: List any major problems you had.




9. Comments: Any comments you wish to add.




*******************************************************************************************************
At this first milestone, you will probably only have material for the first two topics. But include the
other topics, even if you leave them empty, and, if possible, write how you plan to implement
them. For instance, for testing, you may say I intend to use the postman to test the back end, etc.
Do not forget to include in the Project Description:
● The functionalities you are going to implement.
● Navigation diagram for your application linked to the screen mockups. This link can be
just the name of the mockup (i.e. Mockup1, Mockup2, etc) or an HTML link.
● The information you are going to save in the server (no need to decide how that
information will be saved).
